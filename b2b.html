                        With increasingly strong and diversified competition in the sector, the client company wanted to expand its catalog to include products that complemented those it already marketed. To achieve this, the client requested the production of UX guidelines to support the internal redesign of its online store. The aim of the project was to carry out UX Research on a European scale and transcribe the findings into actionable UX guidelines. I took part in this project as a UX designer and was responsible for conducting the research and producing the guidelines.

                        <h2>User Research</h2>
                        <p>
                            As mentioned previously, this project began with the organization of a Europe-wide UX Research study. The aim of this research was to identify the day-to-day life of users, and the challenges posed by their profession in their perception and use of the service offered.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            After building an interview guide and organizing my various visits, I interviewed 14 of the company's customers either in situ or via videoconference in the following countries: France, Germany, Sweden, the Netherlands and Spain.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Once the interviews had been completed, I formalized the research findings for presentation to the project client. I produced a matrix of end-customers' business challenges, their journey by type of purchase, and a view of their management cockpit.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            These elements were then translated into initial UX ideas and recommendations for an intermediate feedback to the client in order to validate the envisioned approach.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="text-group">
                        <h2>UX guidelines and Interfaces</h2>
                        <p>
                            Once the UX tracks had been validated by the client, the work of designing the guidelines could really begin.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I carried out an inspirational benchmark in order to identify best practices relating to the various UX tracks resulting from the research. Secondly, I produced various screens to illustrate the UX guidelines, and structured them in a document specifying the related recommendations and an example on the interface.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Attention was also paid to the tone of voice to be adopted by the client with its customers.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="text-group">
                        <h2>User tests</h2>
                        <p>
                            To validate the elements designed, a user-testing session was organized. I went back to the customers interviewed at the start of the project to present our results. These tests consisted in statically presenting the various interfaces, and gathering customer feedback on each detail.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The necessary modifications were then made to the interfaces and guidelines before delivery to the client.
                        </p>
