                    <h1>Designing business services from a platform perspective</h1>
                    <p class="p-large">
                        In response to the rapid changes in the financial markets, SG has set up SG Markets, a platform giving companies and internal departments access to a range of services designed to facilitate processes in a variety of fields (markets, various financing, global transaction banking, etc.). Working as a product designer in an international team, I support the company's projects in the design and implementation of services on the platform. As the projects are subject to strict confidentiality constraints, I can't dwell on the details of the projects and the methodology used.

                        <h2>Framing the need with a dedicated team</h2>
                        <p>
                            Projects are carried out by small teams, generally comprising a Product Owner (responsible for representing the user and conveying the product vision), a Developer (responsible for technical feasibility and data access) and a Product Designer (responsible for supporting the service design and correctly applying the design system).
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            Once the team has been formed and the project is ready to start, I hold a scoping meeting to identify the needs raised by the business and establish the profile of the users for whom the team will be working. At the end of this discussion, I produce a provisional schedule including all the stages necessary for the successful design of the service in the light of the needs identified.
                        </p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="text-group">
                        <h2>Service design</h2>
                        <p>
                            Service design comprises several key stages: current and target user paths are established, and the target version is translated into wireframes. Once these have been validated, a prototyping phase is carried out to apply the system design components to the first screen drafts. These are then tested with users in the form of interactive prototypes, so that any necessary changes can be made before development work begins. Once the final adaptations have been made, I produce the specifications to facilitate development.   
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            For all my projects, I opt for a co-design approach involving as many stakeholders as possible. In fact, weekly meetings are organized with the team, facilitating decision-making and iterations.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Development follow-up</h2>
                        <p>
                            Once development has started, I stay in regular contact with the developers to help them apply the design system. When this work is complete, I carry out an interface review to check that the prototypes designed by the team are properly implemented.
