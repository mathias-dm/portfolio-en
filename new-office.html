                        As part of the renovation of the offices of its emblematic building, an investment bank approached us to reflect on what the employee experience should be within the new workspace. The project's sponsors wanted the new premises to be a meeting place for the group's employees, designed to spread the culture of innovation to all its business lines.
                        This project was carried out by a multidisciplinary team of 5 people, to which I contributed my expertise as a UX Designer and methodological facilitator. We met with the project's clients on a regular basis to validate each major design stage.

                        <h2>User Research</h2>
                        <p>
                            In order to gain a better understanding of the current situation, and of how employees feel about their premises and the way they work, we conducted 15 semi-structured interviews with various Group functions, with the aim of exploring the following themes: the employee's experience in the office, his or her relationship with colleagues, and his or her relationship with work and the company. A literature review was also carried out, in order to produce a summary of trends in office space and its use by employees.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            I then formalized the typical experience of an employee using experience maps, and the typology of profiles encountered using personas. The learnings were identified via a workshop aimed at producing an affinity diagram. This also enabled the identification of experiential risks to be taken into account in the project.

                        <h2>Defining the place experience</h2>
                        <p>
                            Once the team had correctly identified the employees' usage patterns, we defined the components of the recommended experience for the new offices. We considered not only what the space should symbolize, but also what it should deliver in terms of use and corporate culture. This led to the emergence of an experiential triangle on which the project was based.

                        <h2>Space and event design</h2>
                        <p>
                            In order to embody the desired experience within the space, and to enable clients to envision their own experience, we undertook the design of key spaces and events through a series of team workshops. I then formalized these elements so as to clearly present their aims, contributions and progress.

                        <p>
                            I also produced interactive plans on Figma (on an existing base) to allow better projection of project clients during our final presentation.
