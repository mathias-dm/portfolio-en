                    <h1>Creating an educational board game for children</h1>
                    <p class="p-large">
                        As teaching methods evolve, games are increasingly finding their way into the classroom. This prompted a board game publisher to ask how the games it produces could be used in schools.
                        The aim of the project was to provide the client company with a global research document on possible game applications, as well as a first prototype solution.
                        For this project, the main challenge was to design an experience spanning two phases: the child at school and the child with his parents.

                            Since the school environment involves many different stakeholders, we have chosen to focus on the parent-child-teacher trio.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            The research phase was divided into two main components. Firstly, documentation work was carried out on various subjects such as people's relationship with games, the parent-child relationship in education, the parent-school relationship and specialist publications on the subject.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            In parallel, semi-directive interviews were conducted with teachers, parents and experts in education and child psychology. As a UX Designer, I took part in drawing up the interview guides and writing the research report.

                        <p>
                            Once the research phase had been completed and the team had finalized the literature review, we began researching and formulating our concept through a creativity session that I personally led.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            At the end of this session, the team debriefed and chose to select the following idea: Create a game to teach children how to receive, give and return compliments. We then worked on refining our solution, and "Le Monde des Compliment" was born. It's a kit that allows each child to create a "compliment" card and give it to one of their classmates. Children slip the cards they receive into a special album. They can then show their parents the cards they've received.
                        </p>

                        <p>
                            It was also important to us that the game should be simple in its mechanics, friendly in the relationships it creates, and rewarding by ensuring that every child gets a compliment.
                        </p>

                        <h2>Producing and prototyping</h2>
                        <p>
                            In order to produce a first prototype of our solution, a moodboard with the different graphic tracks chosen was created to decide which one we would go for. I then took part in the production of the game's visuals, as well as the final assembly of the game prototype and its box.
